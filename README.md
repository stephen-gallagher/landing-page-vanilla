The main version I created was using create-react-app and Vanilla CSS, with subpages fleshed out in a single page format. In a professional context I would consider SEO when declaring image names, titles, URL slugs, favicon etc, but as there is no particular subject for this assessment I kept it fairly generic.

The nav I kept pretty simple with the three centre aligned links to fit the brief as closely possible and keep the CSS succinct, but in a professional context I would play around with Flex Box and spacing to include the website name or logo with a link to the homepage on the left side of the nav. The brief specified that this was to be a sticky header so I wrapped the nav inside of a header tag - but maybe to eliminate some code I could just have the nav tag and apply all the styling to this?
